Welcome to Car Game, a fun and simple console-based game where you dodge enemy cars to rack up your score! Itâ€™s written in C++ and runs in the Windows console. Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

## How It Works
1. Youâ€™re in control of a car (itâ€™s ASCII art, but still cool ðŸš—).
2. Enemy cars keep coming down the screen, and your job is to avoid them.
3. The longer you survive, the higher your score. Simple, right? Well, not so fastâ€”things can get tricky as those enemy cars pop up randomly!

## Controls
1. Press A or a to move left.
2. Press D or d to move right.
3. Need a break? Hit Escape (Esc) to exit.
4. Remember: Avoid the enemy cars or itâ€™s game over. ðŸ›‘

## How to Play
1. Start the game from the main menu.
2. Use your quick reflexes to dodge those pesky enemy cars.
3. Keep going to achieve the highest score possible!
4. If you crash into a car, itâ€™s game over. But donâ€™t worry, you can always try again.
